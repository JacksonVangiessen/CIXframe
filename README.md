# CIXframe
 CIXframe is a custom futuristic Java frame layout, which I built as a template for future projects. It aim's to combine fusturistic UI design and practicability, if you have any tipps and tricks feel free to contact me. The most current version can be found [here](/CIXframe/cix_v0.7.jar).
 
## Design
 The frame comes with four colors - grey, red, green and blue - which you can change by clicking on the 'C' on the top right of the frame. The 'I' button iconifies the app and the  red 'X' closes it. By grabbing the frame at the upper part of the frame's header you can drag it around your screen. Diffrent from the default undecorated Java frame, this one has smooth fade in and fade out animations. Optionally you can give your frame a custom title or remove it at all.
 
 On Windows 10 the whole window is transparent but on other operating systems this kind of transparency doesn't work properly right now so it is deactivated for them. On screens with a resolution of less than 1920x1080 the window appears nearly fullsized. On displays with a higher resolution the frame takes only a quarter of the screen.

## Limitations and Warnings
 The .jar files are compiled with Java 13 up to version 0.5. Since version 0.6 it is set to Java 11 for compability reasons on other operating systems than Windows 10. The window is not resizable because the animations would not work properly yet. The application was tested on Windows 10 and Manjaro Linux XFCE4 successfully, but other systems like Debian 10 Buster are not compatible by default. Though you might find a workaround, never give up!
